            Like many millenials I enjoy travel, and I've grown to appreaciate
            brunch (my parents still can't understand the allure of it). <br />
            What I enjoy the most though is the <em>boring stuff</em>. Meeting
            friends for long walks, read, draw, import Italian biscotti and
            other <span title="grandma, in Italian">nonna</span> goods whenever
            I can. 🍪
